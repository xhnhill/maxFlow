All the file could be open by text editor
File  2 could be used to test the whole algorithm, which means it calculates all pairs.
The file has the following format

Final_node_number Final_Edge_Number problem_Node_number minimum_max_flow_value
start_node end_node capacity
....
a matrix that contains the max flow value between each pairs, the size is Final_node_number*Final_node_number

File 1,3,5 could be used to test the single parallelized max flow algorithm, it takes the following data format, separated by white space, this graph is huge
Final_node_number Final_Edge_Number problem_Node_number max_flow_value(between Source:node1 and the Sink: node with the largest index)
start_node end_node capacity
start_node end_node capacity
....
start_node end_node capacity
max_flow_value

Using the following link to generate more graph, https://github.com/xhnhill/MaxFlowGraphGenerator.git
I create it for this project
